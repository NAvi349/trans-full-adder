## Abstract
Conventional CMOS design employs pull-up and pull-down resistors to implement a logic function. While it is fast, it has more number of transistors than the equivalent Transmission Gate Implementation. In addition, the conventional CMOS design has pull-up and pull-down resistors. While the transmission gate logic has fewer gates, it lacks driving capability.

In this design, a 1-bit full adder is designed using conventional CMOS inverters and transmission gate. This results in fewer gates and lesser power dissipation.
